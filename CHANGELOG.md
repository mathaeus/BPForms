## [2.0.0 New architecture and easier customisation of cell dimensions on May 8th, 2014](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/releases/tag/2.0.0)
The 2.0.0 release brings in a [new class architecture](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/raw/master/BPFormsSimpleClassDiagram.jpeg), a `TextView` based input, mechanisms for cell customisation and bug fixes:

- [class architecture refactoring](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/raw/master/BPFormsSimpleClassDiagram.jpeg) [87d7230](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/commit/87d7230)
  - `BPFormInfoCell` no longer subclasses `BPFormCell`, but `UITableViewCell`
  - `BPFormCellProtocol` contains all the methods for a cell that is member of a `BPFormViewController` table. At this point, implemented by `BPFormCell` and `BPFormInfoCell`
  - `BPFormInputCell` became an abstract class, with usable subclasses `BPFormInputTextFieldClass` and `BPFormInputTextViewClass`
  - renamed `BPFormFloatLabelInputCell` to `BPFormFloatInputTextFieldCell` (subclass of `BPFormInputTextFieldCell`)
  - renamed `BPFormMultiLineFloatLabelInputCell` to `BPFormFloatInputTextViewCell` (subclass of `BPFormInputTextViewCell`)
- cell dimensions customization: easy to achieve using `customCellHeight`, `spaceToNextCell`, `customContentHeight`, `customContentWidth`
- Moved validation icon outside the text input control (textfield, textview) [c4f7bba](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/commit/c4f7bba)
- Added keyboard mode to help with using the form view controller in a UIPopover with auto layout [#2](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/pull/2) thanks [@snown](https://github.com/snown)
- fixed keyboard disappear table view animation [499177a](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/commit/499177a) [4c95725](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/commit/4c95725)
- updated input cell validation, for optional cells, so that they aren't validated if empty [8a88078](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/commit/8a88078)
- Renamed `BPTextFieldValidateBlockWithPatternAndMessage` to `BPValidateBlockWithPatternAndMessage` [85eb9d3](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/commit/85eb9d3)

## [1.1.0 Integration with JVFloatLabeledTextField on Mar 13th, 2014](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/releases/tag/1.1.0)
- Integration with [JVFloatLabeledTextField](https://github.com/jverdi/JVFloatLabeledTextField) via subspec - [00d45a7](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/commit/00d45a7) [6eee6bd](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/commit/6eee6bd) [01676aa](https://github.com/bpoplauschi/BPForms/commit/01676aa)
